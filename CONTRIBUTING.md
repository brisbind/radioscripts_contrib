Guides for Contributing
=======================

Any contributions are welcome, no matter how well they are vetted.
We recommend keeping scripts relatively independent.  All scripts
should have a license statement at the top, e.g.:

```
# Licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see LICENSE.rst
# Copyright [authorname]
```
